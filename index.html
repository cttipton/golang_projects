    <p>This site will serve as the landing page for my webapp prototypes, blogs, or whatever else becomes appropriate.</p>
    <p>There isn't much here yet with the exception of the webserver itself, which is powered by pure golang and static files.  You can find the source code on my github page:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/cttipton/iminshell.com">https://github.com/cttipton/iminshell.com</a>.
    </ul>
